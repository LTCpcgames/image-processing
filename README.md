LTC Year 11 Face Detection/Recognition using OpenCV and AWS Rekognition

Before you begin - you'll need the OpenCV libraries installed. Packages
for Raspberry Pi Raspbian (stretch) are available here:

    

detect_opencv.py     - Basic example of using OpenCV with Haar Cascade
                       to do face/eye detection.

recognise_opencv.py  - A modified version of the detect_opencv with the
                       starting point for doing face recognition. Not
                       working yet!

recognise_aws.py     - Example of using AWS Rekognition to do more 
                       advanced face recognition in the 'cloud'. This
                       script needs an AWS account to work.
